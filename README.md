# Game_2048PlusTetris
It is a school project. 
Though the requirements were very low, 
but out of my interest, I have tried to make the game with smooth control &amp; better gaming experience.

In fact, the project just combined 2048 & Tetris these 2 famous games together.

In case you wonder how the combination of 2048 &amp; Tetris would look like:


However, the combination indeed has led to a variety of new logic problem.
For instance,
In the game, in the easy mode, a tile would keep falling down to the grid below every 1 sec with a speed X.
Then, the speed of the falling caused by pressing down arrow should not be larger than X;
otherwise, the logic about the combination of more than 2 tiles will needed to be handled, which would make the program more complex.

The coding style and documentation were not one of the concerns. Therefore, it may be not easy to understand my code.

Uploading this project is just for record.
